# TUI Notes

A terminal-based notes application for quick note-taking and organization, right from your command line.

## Overview

TUI Notes is a lightweight, keyboard-driven notes manager that works entirely in your terminal. Think of it as multiple post-it notes in your CLI - create, edit, organize, and manage notes without ever leaving your terminal environment.

## Features (Planned)

- **Multiple Notes**: Create and manage multiple notes simultaneously
- **Persistent Storage**: All notes are saved automatically and persist between sessions
- **Easy Organization**: Reorder notes to prioritize what matters
- **Clean Interface**: Intuitive terminal UI built with modern TUI libraries
- **Quick Access**: Launch from anywhere in your terminal
- **Note Management**: 
  - Add new notes with custom titles
  - Edit note content
  - Delete notes when no longer needed
  - Clear note content while keeping the note
  - Reorganize note order
